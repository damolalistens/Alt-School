        <h2>About Eden Hazard</h2>
        Eden Michael Walter Hazard (born 7 January 1991) is a Belgian former professional footballer who played as a
        winger or attacking midfielder for Lille, Chelsea, Real Madrid, and the Belgium national team. Known for his
        dribbling and creativity, he is regarded as one of the best players of his generation.Hazard began his senior
        career with Ligue 1 club Lille in 2007 at the age of 16 and soon became an integral part of the Lille team under
        manager Rudi Garcia. After making over 190 appearances and scoring 50 goals for Lille, Hazard signed for English
        club Chelsea in June
        2012. Hazard helped Chelsea win the Football League Cup and Premier League, earning him the FWA
        Footballer of the Year and the PFA Players' Player of the Year awards. At Chelsea, Hazard established himself as
        one of the best players in the world. He joined Real Madrid in the summer
        of 2019 in a transfer worth up to â‚¬150 million, making it one of the highest transfer fees ever. However, injury
        woes, subpar performances, and a lack of fitness led to him only playing a limited number of games, departing
        the club in June 2023 and retiring from professional football four months later.
